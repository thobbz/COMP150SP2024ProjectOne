Did not have time to work on project today (Trinity 3/19)
I joined the project today and I am commiting this to say that I worked yesterday. (Arjun 3/19)


Events Method:
    2nd parser method to get a choice

- Creating Events from Static files
- Storing and Loading user and game information from a file

Theme = Marvel (Infinity War/ Endgame Movie)

I did not have time to work on the project today (3/22)

Notes:

- Do NOT do it in one file.
- Name the python files lowercase and avoid saying the same as the class
- Circular imports
from Class(a) import Class(b)       from Class(b) import Class(b)
    Class(A)                            Class(B)
        __init__                            __init__
        self.class.                         self.class.

Both of them are trying to initialize the other during their own initialization

1. Completely eliminate dependency on each other
2. Class C that loads first

User input parsing class is IDEAL for json and webapi Part 2 of project.
Good enough if you can load a user and get legacy points
 - csv is better than json but both still work

 I did not have time to work a lot on the project today 3/27
